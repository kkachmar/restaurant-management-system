# restaurant-management-system

## What is this?
This is a system to be used by the host/hostess of a restaraunt. It uses visuals to display which tables are available, taken, or reserved. Users can add to a walk-in waitlist, take reservations, and seat customers according to the waitlist.

## How to run this project?
All libraries used are java libraries. Any Java-compatible IDE is able to run the project. I recommend IntelliJ or Eclipse.

The main method for the system is in the `App` class > `App.java`. <br>

## Credits
